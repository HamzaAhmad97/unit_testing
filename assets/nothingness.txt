The more you know about a particle's energy, the less you know about when it is, and vice versa. Here, something weird happens: If you know that there will never be a particle at a particular point, suddenly that point could have any amount of energy, sometimes enough to create a particle anyway.

These particles are called 'virtual particles,' and they're basically quantum fluctuations. Once you make enough 'nothing,' the universe starts trying to find a way to fill it, even if that means creating particles out of thin air to do it.

There's also the possibility that the entire universe is just one big virtual particle. The 'vacuum genesis' hypothesis theorizes that the entire universe began as a big fluctuation in the 'nothing' that came before it. While it hasn't been proven, it sure is an interesting idea to think about: that in the end, all we—you, me, the whole universe—add up to is a big bunch of nothing.
